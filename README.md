## Yes, yet another "Java Web App" usign Spring boot.

This is a sample app that I'm using for demos and PoCs.

> git clone https://github.com/eduardorj/webapp-java-springboot.git

> If you use Maven, you can run the application by using ./mvnw spring-boot:run. Alternatively, you can build the JAR file with ./mvnw clean package and then run the JAR file, as follows:

```

java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

```
